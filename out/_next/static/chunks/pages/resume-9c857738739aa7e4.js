In general, these models can be represented as a system of non-linear PDEs or SDEs and solved using standard methodology such as finite differencing, policy and value function iteration, linearisation, etc. However, for these methods are insufficient for models of certain types - *i.e.*, in the presence of non-linearities, they would fail to find the global solution of the tystem of equations in most cases. I propose a neural network framework that can find the solution to these equations and calibrate the parameteres according to the actual data overcoming the limitations of classical methodology.","For this project, I created a PyTorch pipeline of economy generation (based on the model assumptions), solution of the resulted model, and calibration of the parameters by taking them as learnable parts of the neural network for the iinference step."],more:"In macroeconomic research, especially at central banks, models used for policy analysis are increasingly complex. One prominent class is Heterogeneous-Agent New Keynesian (HANK) models, which incorporate differences across individual agents—like varying incomes or asset holdings—to capture distributional effects of monetary policy. These models are essential for understanding how economic shocks propagate through society. However, solving them is computationally intense. The state spaces are massive, the decision rules are nonlinear, and existing solution techniques buckle under the sheer dimensionality.\n\nTo tackle this, my thesis proposes a machine learning framework for approximating global solutions to such high-dimensional economic models. Specifically, I employ neural networks as flexible function approximators that can learn agents’ optimal behavior directly from the model’s structure, rather than relying on traditional numerical grids. Importantly, the solution framework is not limited to a specific parameter set—it generalizes across the entire parameter space, which lays the groundwork for faster and more flexible model estimation.\n\nThe methodology is first tested on simpler setups: a consumption-saving problem with multiple stochastic shocks, and a representative-agent New Keynesian DSGE model with monopolistic competition. These models serve as benchmarks to demonstrate the interpretability and accuracy of the neural network approximation. In both cases, the framework successfully learns economically meaningful decision rules and reproduces sensible dynamics.\n\nHowever, when scaled up to fully nonlinear HANK models—where heterogeneity and aggregate risk interact—the framework struggles. Despite producing interpretable outcomes in simpler cases, the same approach doesn’t always yield reliable results for HANK models. The problem stems from the difficulty of training neural networks in such irregular and high-dimensional environments. As a response, I suggest refining the training process by targeting the regions of the model’s ergodic state space more effectively and extending the horizon of agents’ simulated expectations via Bellman-style formulations or integral approximations.\n\nIn short, while the current method offers a powerful proof of concept for integrating machine learning into macroeconomic model solution and estimation, further refinements are necessary before it becomes a practical tool for policy-relevant HANK models. The thesis ends by laying out these next steps, focusing on enhancing the training procedure, improving sampling, and bridging the gap between micro-level heterogeneity and macro-level interpretability.\n\n[Download PDF of the thesis](documents/HANK_models.pdf)"},{title:"Analysing Russian Central Bank Communication Impact on Monetary Policy Effectiveness With Natural Language Processing",subtitle:"HSE, Faculty of Economic Sciences (supervisor: Mariam Mamedli)",start_date:"2022-01-01",end_date:"2022-06-21",desc:"Customized transformer models to extract economic information from Russian Central Bank releases; demonstrated that informational channels improve instrument strength in SVAR monetary-shock analysis.",more:"## Uncovering the Hidden Signals in Central Bank Communications\n\nThis research project was a bit of a deep dive into an intersection of monetary policy, market microstructure, and NLP. The idea was to investigate how the Russian Central Bank's official communications—press releases, to be specific—affect financial markets, beyond the standard interest rate decisions. Central banks don’t just set rates—they signal outlooks, priorities, even concerns. And I wanted to see if we could measure that informational content directly.\n\nIn most standard macro models, a change in the interest rate is treated as the whole story. But in reality, the announcement often conveys much more: a shift in tone, a new focus, a subtle readjustment in economic expectations. These implicit signals can either reinforce or counteract the effect of the rate change. This idea isn’t new—papers like Nakamura & Steinsson (2018) and Jarociński & Karadi (2020) have shown that central bank communications contain this ‘information effect’. But these papers mostly focus on the US. I was curious: does the same logic apply to an emerging market like Russia?\n\nTo get at this hidden information layer, I adapted a methodology originally proposed by Cai et al. (2021). The idea is to use natural language processing to model expectations of the key interest rate before and after the Central Bank's press release. For this, I used press articles from a major Russian business outlet (RBC.ru) to capture public sentiment before the release, and then the Bank’s own official statement for after. Using BERT-based embeddings (from Sberbank and DeepPavlov), I converted the texts into vectors and built models to predict the expected key rate based on each source.\n\nIf the expectations before and after the release diverged, it implied that the Central Bank revealed new information the market hadn’t anticipated. This “expectation gap” became my proxy for the informational component of the monetary policy shock. The rest—the pure surprise from the rate change—was treated as a standard monetary policy shock.\n\nTo test if this approach held water, I ran regressions against high-frequency price changes in Russian government bond futures and currency futures, controlling for other market noise. I found that, yes—the difference in expectations did explain part of the market’s immediate reaction. Interestingly, in several cases, the informational effect worked against the policy move. For example, a dovish rate cut might come with a gloomy economic outlook, which could neutralise or even reverse the expected positive market reaction.\n\nThe second part of the project was all about macro impact. I plugged the “cleaned” monetary shock (with the information component stripped out) into a Structural VAR model to trace how shocks propagate through the real economy—output, inflation, credit spreads, etc. For the small open economy version of the model, the results weren’t perfect (Russian data quirks and small sample sizes definitely didn’t help), but in the baseline model, the responses looked broadly in line with what you’d expect: inflation goes down, credit spreads go up, and so on.\n\nIn the end, the project showed that market reactions to monetary policy in Russia are not just about the numbers—they’re also about the story being told. And with the help of NLP and some clever econometrics, we can actually start to unpack that story.\n\n[See the project on

data—something that could later be used for various downstream tasks. The motivation came from a pretty common problem in production-level models used by market makers. Take, for instance, an optimal trade execution model—one that tries to decide the best time, size, and price for a trade so it gets executed quickly and cheaply.\n\nNow, if the trade size is large enough, it might clear several levels of the book and push the price to a less favorable level. But if you train such models on historical data alone, they never really learn what effect their actions have on the price—they have no concept of market impact. As a result, they tend to make decisions that are theoretically optimal in hindsight but not in practice. So the idea is: what if we could generate synthetic data that is dynamic and reactive to agents’ behavior, but still behaves like the real thing?\n\nThe standard way of generating such data is to hand-craft an environment based on something like a stochastic differential equation (SDE), which, if well-tuned, mimics how a product moves in response to actions in the market. But this approach relies heavily on the researcher being right about how the market works—which is a big “if.”\n\nSo instead, I looked into a more flexible, non-parametric approach: using diffusion models. These models start with actual LOB data (in short time windows), then progressively add noise until all structure is gone (basically pure Gaussian noise). A neural network is then trained to reverse this process and reconstruct the original data from the noise—learning, in effect, the underlying data distribution.\n\nThe goal of this research internship was to test whether this kind of generative model could actually recreate realistic LOB behavior. A key point here is that at the level of individual order updates, the data isn't driven by macroeconomic news or trends—it’s just local interactions, which renders most standard predictive approaches pretty useless.\n\nI experimented with various architectures—convolutional and RNN-based denoisers—and came to an interesting conclusion. Even though transformer-style models are typically the go-to for sequence data, in this case, reshaping the LOB windows into image-like matrices (centered around the mid-price at time 0) and using a standard stable diffusion model gave better results. This image-based setup allowed the model to learn the implicit logic of how the book gets cleared and filled—and it managed to reproduce the fine-grained dynamics of the LOB quite well.\n",pdfLink:"/documents/TS_diffusion_slides.pdf",descLink:"View project presentation slides (internship report)"},{name:"Tinkoff Bank, TCS Group",position:"Risk Analyst, Revolving Credit Products",url:"https://tinkoff-group.com/",startDate:"2023-03-01",endDate:"2023-08-31",location:" Moscow, Russia",summary:"Credit Risk Analytics",highlights:["Developed and integrated a risk-free limit pricing strategy for the main credit product","Maintained and extended statistical models for counter-party risk prediction","Conducted AB-test sensitivity studies and built an NPV model","Performed Monte Carlo stress tests on the credit portfolio"],more:"\n## Risk-Neutral Pricing via Randomised A/B Testing\nI worked in the Risk Analytics team at Tinkoff, focusing on the revolver credit products portfolio. Day-to-day, we calibrated and monitored models of client behaviour. Each client was essentially treated as a separate project, exhibiting behavioural patterns similar to others with comparable characteristics. These behavioural models were built on vintages of past clients and regularly recalibrated against the most recent cohorts.\nMy team conducted monthly calibrations and stress tests on the entire client portfolio for a given product, to ensure that the overall risk exposure remained within acceptable limits and that the required return targets were being met.\n\nMy main project was the development of a new risk-neutral pricing scheme using a randomised A/B testing framework. Instead of assigning clients the usual predetermined product terms (such as interest rate, credit limit, repayment schedule, etc.), we introduced randomisation into these parameters for a portion of the clients. This created an ideal setup for applying econometric tools like Difference-in-Differences or Synthetic Control.\n\nThe core hypothesis was that for clients with certain risk profiles, there might be more effective product terms that lead to a lower overall default rate. The test group received product terms that were randomly varied, while the control group continued under the existing pricing strategy. If the treatment had been categorical (e.g. a “yes/no” change), we could have simply run a standard RCT. But since our “treatment” involved continuous variation—like sampling an interest rate from a range or applying a random multiplier to the standard rate—analysing the outcome became significantly more complex.\n\nTo handle this, I developed a propensity score framework to estimate the likelihood of a client receiving a “higher” treatment, based on their characteristics. This was viable because only part of the new product terms were randomised; the rest still depended on fundamental client features. Using this score, I grouped clients into strata with similar treatment probabilities. Within these groups, I was then able to compare outcomes using straightforward RCT logic—assessing how the new pricing terms influenced client behaviour.\n\nOff the back of the test results, I worked closely with senior risk managers to identify more effective pricing terms and propose a revised product strategy. We rolled out the new scheme in production, again using an A/B test to measure its impact on client behaviour in real-world conditions."},{name:"Biofarminvest Ltd.",position:"Operations Manager",url:"https://ribav.ru/",startDate:"2019-07-01",endDate:"2024-01-31",location:" Ramenskoye, Russia",summary:"Agricultural biotech startup",highlights:["Optimised production and delivery operations; researched product-line extensions and conducted market monitoring","Managed cross-border sales and relationships with international clients","Negotiated research contracts and developed a client-relations system (CRS)"]},{name:"Higher School of Economics",position:"Teaching Assistant",url:"https://www.hse.ru/",startDate:"2022-09-01",endDate:"2024-07-31",location:" Moscow, Russia",summary:"Taught courses at Faculties of Economic and Computer Sciencesas assisant to the lecturer and as a composer of practice sessions.",highlights:["Compiled and taught [“Data Analysis in Python”  practice sessions](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgt6p-DpESX4dl2n-yAZPK4bRRCw-rVPH&si=DSjs8TfIvG01eswb); prepared seminars and quizes, graded exam papers.
