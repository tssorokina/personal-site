In general, these models can be represented as a system of non-linear PDEs or SDEs and solved using standard methodology such as finite differencing, policy and value function iteration, linearisation, etc. However, for these methods are insufficient for models of certain types - *i.e.*, in the presence of non-linearities, they would fail to find the global solution of the tystem of equations in most cases. I propose a neural network framework that can find the solution to these equations and calibrate the parameteres according to the actual data overcoming the limitations of classical methodology.","For this project, I created a PyTorch pipeline of economy generation (based on the model assumptions), solution of the resulted model, and calibration of the parameters by taking them as learnable parts of the neural network for the iinference step."],more:"In macroeconomic research, especially at central banks, models used for policy analysis are increasingly complex. One prominent class is Heterogeneous-Agent New Keynesian (HANK) models, which incorporate differences across individual agents—like varying incomes or asset holdings—to capture distributional effects of monetary policy. These models are essential for understanding how economic shocks propagate through society. However, solving them is computationally intense. The state spaces are massive, the decision rules are nonlinear, and existing solution techniques buckle under the sheer dimensionality.\n\nTo tackle this, my thesis proposes a machine learning framework for approximating global solutions to such high-dimensional economic models. Specifically, I employ neural networks as flexible function approximators that can learn agents’ optimal behavior directly from the model’s structure, rather than relying on traditional numerical grids. Importantly, the solution framework is not limited to a specific parameter set—it generalizes across the entire parameter space, which lays the groundwork for faster and more flexible model estimation.\n\nThe methodology is first tested on simpler setups: a consumption-saving problem with multiple stochastic shocks, and a representative-agent New Keynesian DSGE model with monopolistic competition. These models serve as benchmarks to demonstrate the interpretability and accuracy of the neural network approximation. In both cases, the framework successfully learns economically meaningful decision rules and reproduces sensible dynamics.\n\nHowever, when scaled up to fully nonlinear HANK models—where heterogeneity and aggregate risk interact—the framework struggles. Despite producing interpretable outcomes in simpler cases, the same approach doesn’t always yield reliable results for HANK models. The problem stems from the difficulty of training neural networks in such irregular and high-dimensional environments. As a response, I suggest refining the training process by targeting the regions of the model’s ergodic state space more effectively and extending the horizon of agents’ simulated expectations via Bellman-style formulations or integral approximations.\n\nIn short, while the current method offers a powerful proof of concept for integrating machine learning into macroeconomic model solution and estimation, further refinements are necessary before it becomes a practical tool for policy-relevant HANK models. The thesis ends by laying out these next steps, focusing on enhancing the training procedure, improving sampling, and bridging the gap between micro-level heterogeneity and macro-level interpretability.\n\n[Download PDF of the thesis](documents/HANK_models.pdf)"},{title:"Analysing Russian Central Bank Communication Impact on Monetary Policy Effectiveness With Natural Language Processing",subtitle:"HSE, Faculty of Economic Sciences (supervisor: Mariam Mamedli)",start_date:"2022-01-01",end_date:"2022-06-21",desc:"Customized transformer models to extract economic information from Russian Central Bank releases; demonstrated that informational channels improve instrument strength in SVAR monetary-shock analysis.",more:"## Uncovering the Hidden Signals in Central Bank Communications\n\nThis research project was a bit of a deep dive into an intersection of monetary policy, market microstructure, and NLP. The idea was to investigate how the Russian Central Bank's official communications—press releases, to be specific—affect financial markets, beyond the standard interest rate decisions. Central banks don’t just set rates—they signal outlooks, priorities, even concerns. And I wanted to see if we could measure that informational content directly.\n\nIn most standard macro models, a change in the interest rate is treated as the whole story. But in reality, the announcement often conveys much more: a shift in tone, a new focus, a subtle readjustment in economic expectations. These implicit signals can either reinforce or counteract the effect of the rate change. This idea isn’t new—papers like Nakamura & Steinsson (2018) and Jarociński & Karadi (2020) have shown that central bank communications contain this ‘information effect’. But these papers mostly focus on the US. I was curious: does the same logic apply to an emerging market like Russia?\n\nTo get at this hidden information layer, I adapted a methodology originally proposed by Cai et al. (2021). The idea is to use natural language processing to model expectations of the key interest rate before and after the Central Bank's press release. For this, I used press articles from a major Russian business outlet (RBC.ru) to capture public sentiment before the release, and then the Bank’s own official statement for after. Using BERT-based embeddings (from Sberbank and DeepPavlov), I converted the texts into vectors and built models to predict the expected key rate based on each source.\n\nIf the expectations before and after the release diverged, it implied that the Central Bank revealed new information the market hadn’t anticipated. This “expectation gap” became my proxy for the informational component of the monetary policy shock. The rest—the pure surprise from the rate change—was treated as a standard monetary policy shock.\n\nTo test if this approach held water, I ran regressions against high-frequency price changes in Russian government bond futures and currency futures, controlling for other market noise. I found that, yes—the difference in expectations did explain part of the market’s immediate reaction. Interestingly, in several cases, the informational effect worked against the policy move. For example, a dovish rate cut might come with a gloomy economic outlook, which could neutralise or even reverse the expected positive market reaction.\n\nThe second part of the project was all about macro impact. I plugged the “cleaned” monetary shock (with the information component stripped out) into a Structural VAR model to trace how shocks propagate through the real economy—output, inflation, credit spreads, etc. For the small open economy version of the model, the results weren’t perfect (Russian data quirks and small sample sizes definitely didn’t help), but in the baseline model, the responses looked broadly in line with what you’d expect: inflation goes down, credit spreads go up, and so on.\n\nIn the end, the project showed that market reactions to monetary policy in Russia are not just about the numbers—they’re also about the story being told. And with the help of NLP and some clever econometrics, we can actually start to unpack that story.\n\n[See the project on GitHub](https://github.com/tssorokina/information_component_of_monetary_shocks)\n\n[Download PDF of the paper](documents/Monetary_Shocks_with_NLP)"}]},3723:(e,t,n)=>{(window.__NEXT_P=window.__NEXT_P||[]).push(["/projects",function(){return n(4574)}])},4574:(e,t,n)=>{"use strict";n.r(t),n.d(t,{default:()=>l}),n(4232);var o=n(8230),r=n.n(o),a=n(6342),i=n(405),s=n(7876);let l=()=>(0,s.jsxs)("article",{className:"post",id:"projects",children:[(0,s.jsx)("header",{children:(0,s.jsxs)("div",{className:"title",children:[(0,s.jsx)("h2",{children:(0,s.jsx)(r(),{href:"/projects",children:"Projects"})}),(0,s.jsx)("p",{children:"A selection of my research projects"})]})}),i.A.map(e=>(0,s.jsx)(a.A,{data:e},e.title))]})},6342:(e,t,n)=>{"use strict";n.d(t,{A:()=>y});var o=n(4232),r=n(5062),a=n.n(r),i=n(6557),s=n.n(i),l=n(5072),c=n(1772),h=n(9243),d=n(1041),m=n(7876);let p=["children"];function u(e,t){var n=Object.keys(e);if(Object.getOwnPropertySymbols){var o=Object.getOwnPropertySymbols(e);t&&(o=o.filter(function(t){return Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(e,t).enumerable})),n.push.apply(n,o)}return n}function f(e){for(var t=1;t<arguments.length;t++){var n=null!=arguments[t]?arguments[t]:{};t%2?u(Object(n),!0).forEach(function(t){var o,r,a;o=e,r=t,a=n[t],(r=function(e){var t=function(e,t){if("object"!=typeof e||null===e)return e;var n=e[Symbol.toPrimitive];if(void 0!==n){var o=n.call(e,t||"default");if("object"!=typeof o)return o;throw TypeError("@@toPrimitive must return a primitive value.")}return("string"===t?String:Number)(e)}(e,"string");return"symbol"==typeof t?t:String(t)}(r))in o?Object.defineProperty(o,r,{value:a,enumerable:!0,configurable:!0,writable:!0}):o[r]=a}):Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptors?Object.defineProperties(e,Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptors(n)):u(Object(n)).forEach(function(t){Object.defineProperty(e,t,Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(n,t))})}return e}let g=e=>{let{data:t}=e,[n,r]=(0,o.useState)(!1);return(0,m.jsxs)("article",{className:"project-container",children:[(0,m.jsxs)("header",{children:[(0,m.jsx)("h4",{className:"project-title",children:(0,m.jsx)("a",{href:t.link,target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer",children:t.title})}),t.subtitle&&(0,m.jsx)("p",{className:"project-subtitle",children:t.subtitle}),(0,m.jsxs)("p",{className:"project-details",children:[(0,m.jsx)("span",{className:"project-date",children:s()(t.date).format("MMMM YYYY")}),t.location&&(0,m.jsxs)("span",{className:"project-location",children:["– ",t.location]})]})]}),t.image&&(0,m.jsx)("div",{className:"project-image",children:(0,m.jsx)("img",{src:t.image,alt:t.title})}),t.desc&&(0,m.jsx)("div",{className:"job-summary",children:(0,m.jsx)("span",{children:t.desc})}),t.highlights&&t.highlights.length>0&&(0,m.jsx)("ul",{className:"points",children:t.highlights.map(e=>(0,m.jsx)("li",{children:(0,m.jsx)(l.Ay,{children:e})},e))}),t.more&&(0,m.jsxs)("div",{className:"job-more",style:{marginBottom:"2em"},children:[(0,m.jsx)("button",{type:"button",className:"read-more-btn",onClick:()=>r(e=>!e),"aria-expanded":n,style:{marginTop:"0.5em",marginBottom:"0.5em"},children:n?"Show less":"Show details"}),n&&(0,m.jsx)("div",{className:"job-more-content",children:(0,m.jsx)(l.Ay,{options:{overrides:{a:{component:e=>{let{children:t}=e,n=function(e,t){if(null==e)return{};var n,o,r=function(e,t){if(null==e)return{};var n,o,r={},a=Object.keys(e);for(o=0;o<a.length;o++)n=a[o],t.indexOf(n)>=0||(r[n]=e[n]);return r}(e,t);if(Object.getOwnPropertySymbols){var a=Object.getOwnPropertySymbols(e);for(o=0;o<a.length;o++)n=a[o],!(t.indexOf(n)>=0)&&Object.prototype.propertyIsEnumerable.call(e,n)&&(r[n]=e[n])}return r}(e,p);return"string"==typeof t[0]&&t[0].toLowerCase().includes("github")?(0,m.jsxs)("a",f(f({},n),{},{target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer",children:[(0,m.jsx)(c.g,{icon:h.Vz,style:{marginRight:"0.3em"}}),t]})):"string"==typeof t[0]&&t[0].toLowerCase().includes("download pdf")?(0,m.jsxs)("a",f(f({},n),{},{target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer",children:[(0,m.jsx)(c.g,{icon:d.cbP,style:{marginRight:"0.3em"}}),t]})):(0,m.jsx)("a",f(f({},n),{},{target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer",children:t}))}}}},children:t.more})})]})]})};g.propTypes={data:a().shape({title:a().string.isRequired,link:a().string.isRequired,subtitle:a().string,date:a().string.isRequired,location:a().string,image:a().string,desc:a().string.isRequired,highlights:a().arrayOf(a().string),more:a().node}).isRequired};let y=g}},e=>{var t=t=>e(e.s=t);e.O(0,[725,740,636,593,792],()=>t(3723)),_N_E=e.O()}]);
